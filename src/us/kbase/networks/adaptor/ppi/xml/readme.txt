XML representation of ER diagram for PPI:

KSaplingDBD.xml is a patched version of the file (but which will
become out of sync with the version in kb_seed)

ksapling_dbd_patch.txt is a patch that patches lib/KSaplingDBD.xml
in the kb_seed repo

After merging PPI into the CS, these files should be tracked in the
kb_seed repo instead of this one.
